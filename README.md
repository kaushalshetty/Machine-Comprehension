# Machine-Comprehension
A simple implementation of DrQA neural network architecture for machine comprehension

Unable to upload the data files due to its large size but MachineComprehension model is reusable.

#### To initialize the model
```
mc = MachineComprehension(c_maxlen,q_maxlen,embeddings)
```
#### To run the model with data files
```
python model.py
```
